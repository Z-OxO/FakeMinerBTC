      This is a fake Bitcoin miner created using Python. Please note that I am a
      beginner and this project is for educational purposes only.
    </p>
    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p>
      This fake Bitcoin miner works by simulating the mining process without
      actually solving any complex mathematical algorithms. It simply generates
      random numbers and displays them as the solution to the mining problem.
    </p>
    <h2>Installation and Usage</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Clone the repository to your local machine.
        <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Z-OxO/FakeMinerBTC.git</code></pre>

      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used to
      mine real Bitcoin. The mining process is complex and requires specialized
      hardware and software. Attempting to mine Bitcoin without proper equipment
      and knowledge can result in financial loss.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This fake Bitcoin miner is a simple project that demonstrates the mining
      process in a basic way. I hope you find it informative and helpful in
      understanding how mining works. As a beginner, I welcome any feedback or
      suggestions for improvement.
